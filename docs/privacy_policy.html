        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Effective Date: February 10, 2026</p>

        <p>
            At Save Button, we believe your data belongs to you. This Privacy
            Policy outlines our commitment to your privacy and explains how we
            handle information within the app.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Personal Information</h2>

        <p>
            Save Button does not collect, store, or share any personal
            information. We do not require you to create an account, provide an
            email address, or link your social media profiles to use the app. We
            do not use trackers or sell your data to third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Bookmarks and User Content</h2>

        <p>
            The primary function of Save Button is to help you organize links.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Optional Storage: If you choose to use the Server feature, the
                app will store the bookmarks you provide on our servers or a
                self-hosted server of your option.
            </li>
            <li>
                Control: This feature is entirely optional. You can use the app
                without backing up data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Data Location: Depending on your device settings, these
                bookmarks are stored locally on your device or locally and
                backed up to our servers.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Permissions</h2>

        <p>
            The app may request basic permissions (such as "Share Sheet" access)
            solely to allow you to send links to the app. We do not use these
            permissions to access your photos, contacts, or location.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Since we do not
            collect contact information, we recommend checking this page
            periodically for any changes.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Summary: Your privacy is built into the core of Save Button. We save
            your links only if you ask us to, and we never know who you are.
